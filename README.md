# DESCRIPTION
Basic full stack blackjack game built with MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js

This is one of the apps that I built when initially learning JavaScript, so please excuse the lack of CSS. I mainly wanted to build a full stack application that stores user data (username, password, bankroll) and runs all the essential game logic. I've included a few GIFs below to highlight the functionality.

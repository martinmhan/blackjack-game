# Description
Blackjack: MongoDB | Express | React | Node.js

Please excuse the lack of CSS, as this is one of the first apps I built when initially learning JavaScript. I primarily wanted to practice building a full stack application that requires some data persistence (username, password, bankroll) and a decent level of game logic.

I've included a few GIF demos below.
